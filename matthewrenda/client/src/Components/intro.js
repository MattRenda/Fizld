                        Hard-working web developer, with a passion for problem solving in the least amount of time.
                        I have worked in many groups on multiple projects during my time at CSUS. I've collaborated with 
                        small start ups to improve their productivity and sales. I am passionate about software 
                        development and enjoy what I do.
